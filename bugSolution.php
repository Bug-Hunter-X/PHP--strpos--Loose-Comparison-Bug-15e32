The solution is to use strict comparison (`===`) instead of loose comparison (`==`) when checking the result of `strpos()`.  Strict comparison ensures that you're only matching if the needle is actually found at the beginning of the haystack, and not if it's simply not found anywhere.

```php
$haystack = "This is a test string";
$needle = "test";
if (strpos($haystack, $needle) === 0) {
  echo "Needle found at the beginning!";
} else {
  echo "Needle not found at the beginning!";
}

$haystack = "This is a test string";
$needle = "notfound";
if (strpos($haystack, $needle) === 0) {
  echo "Needle found at the beginning!";
} else {
  echo "Needle not found at the beginning!";
}
```

By using strict comparison, the code will correctly identify whether the needle is located at the start of the haystack.
