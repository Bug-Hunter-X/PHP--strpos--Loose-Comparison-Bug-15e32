This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in PHP related to the use of loose comparison operators (`==`) with the `strpos()` function.  The `strpos()` function returns `false` when a substring is not found, which evaluates to 0 in a loose comparison. This can lead to incorrect results if you are checking if a substring is at the beginning of a string. The `bug.php` file shows the problematic code.  The `bugSolution.php` shows the corrected code, using strict comparison (`===`) to prevent this.
